I've discussed one aspect of the implementation of this algorithm [in a public gist](https://gist.github.com/Nostracodus/5c74b56ba5e7f0731f9815593a6f207b). In this gist, I propose a change to the parsing algorithm to simplify the implementation.

# Description

This is a tool that implements the Earley parsing algorithm as given by Elizabeth Scott and Adrian Johnstone in [Recognition is not parsing â€” SPPF-style parsing from cubic recognisers](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82746212.pdf).

Traditional Earley parser algorithms are based on adding links between items and walking the links post-parse to construct some form of derivation. This algorithm instead builds a derivation graph during parsing.
