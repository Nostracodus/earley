# Description

This is a tool that implements the Earley parsing algorithm as given by Elizabeth Scott and Adrian Johnstone in Recognition is not parsing â€” SPPF-style parsing from cubic recognisers.
Traditional Earley parser algorithms are based on adding links between items and walking the links post-parse to construct some form of derivation. This algorithm instead builds a derivation graph during parsing.
